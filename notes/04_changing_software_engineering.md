# Changing Software Engineering

<hr>

The sources indicate that the software engineering field is undergoing a **fundamental transformation** due to the emergence of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), marking an **inflection point** for both novice and expert developers. This current opportunity for GenAI in coding is a direct result of the convergence of two major trends: the continuous progression of software development tools over many decades and the rapid emergence of large language models (LLMs) from the artificial intelligence (AI) space.

**Evolution of Software Engineering Tools Leading to GenAI's Opportunity**:
Software development has consistently evolved with new tools that have streamlined processes and enhanced productivity. Historically, tools like Maestro I (the first integrated development environment or IDE), Borland's Turbo Pascal, and Visual Studio improved coding, file management, debugging, compilation, and execution. Modern Python IDEs such as Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, and Spyder further facilitate global changes, code highlighting, and syntax checking. Version control systems like Git, build tools such as Jenkins and Maven, and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) systems have all accelerated software delivery. Software testing frameworks and code analysis/refactoring tools (e.g., SonarQube, ReSharper) have also played a crucial role, with some even using AI and pattern matching to fix coding problems. Innovations like Kite offered AI-powered automated code completion and instant documentation, boosting development speed for a large user base before its cessation in 2021. This long history of tool advancement laid the groundwork for GenAI's current impact.

**The Rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) as the Catalyst**:
The recent **unprecedented ascent of LLMs** is the primary driver of the current GenAI opportunity. While AI began formally in 1956, initial ambitions faced limitations. Machine Learning (ML), a sub-field of AI, emerged as a viable solution, with deep learning and neural networks revolutionizing Natural Language Processing (NLP). LLMs are expanded language models, trained on massive datasets and billions of parameters, initially designed to predict the next word. Critically, these LLMs can also be **trained on software code** from public repositories like GitHub, enabling them to predict the next block of code, generate comments, write tests, and even refactor code. This capability extends GenAI's influence across the entire **Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)**.

**Impact on the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)**:
While many associate software development primarily with coding, actual programming accounts for only 25-35% of the overall effort. GenAI offers the opportunity to **supercharge the entire SDLC**, from gathering requirements to planning, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance. For instance, GenAI has been shown to reduce time in the analysis phase (requirements engineering) by up to 60%, development time by 30%, and unit test generation by 25%. Importantly, code quality has been reported to improve by 25%, leading to fewer bugs and lower maintenance costs.

**Key GenAI Tools for the Current Opportunity**:
The current opportunity is largely facilitated by three dominant GenAI software tools:

- **ChatGPT**: An AI-driven chatbot launched in December 2022, known for its rapid user adoption and conversational interface. It is highly effective for text conversations using natural language, but **prompt engineering** is a more robust technique for desired outputs.
- **OpenAI API**: Provides a developer platform for direct coding against the same OpenAI LLMs used by ChatGPT, allowing developers to combine software and prompt engineering for added functionality and specific features useful for software engineering problems.
- **GitHub Copilot**: Released in 2021, this tool is powered by OpenAI's LLM and acts as an **intelligent code completion tool and an AI pair programmer**. It integrates with IDEs like Visual Studio Code and PyCharm, interpreting intent from code context to suggest code, provide references, and offer annotated examples.

**Benefits and Productivity Gains**:
Studies highlight significant productivity increases:

- McKinsey reported gains of **up to 50%**, particularly for routine tasks, repetitive work, initial project exploration, code documentation, and generation. Users also reported feeling happier and more focused on meaningful work.
- Exadel found that two-thirds of developers using GitHub Copilot completed tasks **10-30% faster**, feeling more productive and fulfilled.
- The authors themselves experienced a **15% increase in coding speed** within three months of using an earlier Copilot version, and after two years, the combination of Copilot, ChatGPT, and OpenAI API **doubled their coding output**. Beyond just writing code, GenAI assists in refactoring code for readability, improving code through faster algorithms, automating documentation, and creating tests. It is also invaluable for learning new languages or frameworks.

**Downsides and Challenges**:
Despite the advantages, GenAI for software development is still nascent. Early studies (2022) showed GitHub Copilot's accuracy in producing correct code was **below 50%**. GenAI has been known to produce severe development mistakes, such as exposing secret tokens or causing microservice crashes. It excels at widely documented problems (e.g., Fibonacci sequence) but struggles with more obscure tasks due to less training data. Like general LLMs, GenAI can **"hallucinate" or fabricate information** in software engineering contexts. There are also concerns about **cognitive offloading**, where developers might lose their programming edge by relying too heavily on automatic suggestions.

**Current Opportunity and Future Outlook**:
The "vibe coding" trend (rapid prototyping with extensive GenAI use) demonstrates the technology's advanced capabilities, but prototypes are not production code. The book emphasizes that to truly leverage GenAI and **supercharge coding tasks throughout the SDLC**, developers must **develop new skills to formalize inputs and outputs from LLMs**. This structured approach is crucial for achieving consistent quality code and effectively owning the generated output. The ability to write quality code substantially faster, automate testing, and documentation reduces software development costs, increasing the demand for software and altering the economics of software engineering. While GenAI currently enhances skills in software construction and testing, its future will likely expand to more aspects of software engineering beyond coding tasks.
